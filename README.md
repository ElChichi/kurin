# Kurin

Very little helper with an example to create simple and [clean](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) [Go](https://golang.org/) app. Mostly for own usage, but maybe can inspire you how to structure your own go app.

Strongly inspired by [CaptaionCodeman's project](https://github.com/CaptainCodeman/clean-go), so please check his project for more details about this structure.
